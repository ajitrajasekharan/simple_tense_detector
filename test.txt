We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries.
He fell down and broke his leg
Her hypophysitis secondary to ipilimumab was well managed with supplemental hormones
She imagined herself going into the future and baking a cake
He fell down and bled to death near the park where children were playing and having fun with their parents
Before going to the school he decided to examine the landscape
He will try to fly his kite again tomorrow
He plans to finish his school sometime in the distant future
Patient history includes asthma and peanut allergy
He could finish his homework if he only tried
